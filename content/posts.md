# Washington State

*2021.1.20.* I learned some Blender and used some open source elevation data to make a nice looking relief map of Washington State. Check out how I made it [here](https://github.com/mattf1n/Relief-Map).

# `pip install vest`

*2020.7.1*. I really like [Wealthfront](https://wealthfront.com), so I decided
to create my own robo-advisor which I call
[Vest](https://pypi.org/project/vest/). Vest features a command line interface
built with [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/) and connects with
[Robinhood](https://robinhood.com) via an unofficial Python API [Robin
$tocks](https://robin-stocks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). Feel free to
take a look at Vest on my [GitHub](https://github.com/mattf1n/vest)!

# VimMarp.vim

*2020.6.17*. I created a plugin for my current favorite text editor
[Vim](https://www.vim.org) to allow me to write presentations in markdown and
render them as I go using the [Marp CLI](https://marp.app). This was my first
time writing a Vim plugin and my first time using Vim script. [This online
guide](https://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com) was very helpful. Check
out the [VimMarp repository](https://github.com/mattf1n/VimMarp) on my GitHub!

# Camping in Cottonwood Wash

*2020.5.14*. This last weekend, [Caitlyn](http://caitlyndang.com) and I
backpacked up Cottonwood Wash in Utah's San Rafael Swell. There was not a soul
to be seen and it was a truly beautiful canyon all to ourselves. We even
spotted some petroglyphs. We were told about this canyon by my uncle
and found our way there using two outdated maps and some help from the locals.

# Course notes from CS183

*2020.4.20*. [These are my notes](files/lecture.pdf) from the course CS183:
Foundations of Machine Learning. They are imperfect and incomplete but I really
enjoyed making them. If you would like to make edits [email
me](mailto:matthewbfinlayson@gmail.com) and I can send you the source code.

<!--# The TNT game -->

<!--*2020.4.18*. While taking a class on theoretical computer science last semester-->
<!--someone showed me [the NAND game](http://nandgame.com/). The idea of the game-->
<!--is to start from a [NAND gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAND_gate) and-->
<!--build a series of [boolean-->
<!--circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_circuit) of increasing-->
<!--complexity until you build a computer in a surprisingly few number of rounds.-->
<!--While reading the book *[Gödel, Escher,-->
<!--Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gödel,_Escher,_Bach)* by Douglas-->
<!--Hofstadter, I began imagining a similar 'game' where the user begins with a-->
<!--small set of axioms and rules from  which they build theorems of increasing-->
<!--complexity. The axioms and rules could come from Hofstadter's [TNT-->
<!--system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographical_Number_Theory).  The game-->
<!--would begin by establishing basic properties of addition, multiplication, and-->
<!--so on, eventually proving profound mathematical concepts like Fermat's last-->
<!--theorem (about which I would recommend reading [this book by Simon-->
<!--Singh](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38412.Fermat_s_Enigma).) -->

<!--I'm not sure exactly how something like [Gödel's incompleteness-->
<!--theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems)-->
<!--could be incorporated into the game. It's something I will have to keep-->
<!--thinking about. :space_invader: -->

<!--# Notice anything new?-->

<!--*2020.4.17*. I overhauled the look of this site by ditching-->
<!--[Marx](https://github.com/mblode/marx) and making my own custom CSS file. I-->
<!--wanted an academic look for the site so I found [Latin-->
<!--Modern](https://github.com/slashfoo/lmweb) for web (LM is the $\LaTeX$ default-->
<!--font.) Also, inspired by [Butterick's Practical-->
<!--Typography](https://practicaltypography.com/) which is an amazing online book,-->
<!--I decided to go with more subtle links. They are now all [small caps](). The-->
<!--downside of this is that links do not pop out so much. Upside is that the focus-->
<!--is now more on the text!-->

<!--Oh, and I added a [favicon](https://favicon.io/). :nail_care: -->

# [iloveyoumatthew.com](https://Iloveyoumatthew.com)

*2020.4.16*. My [girlfriend](https://caitlyndang.com) made me this love-letter
website for Valentines day. I love it! (I hope I'm not embarrassing myself too
much here.) :heart:
