# Washington State

*2021.1.20.* I learned some Blender and used some open source elevation data to make a nice looking relief map of Washington State. Check out how I made it [here](https://github.com/mattf1n/Relief-Map).

# Camping in Cottonwood Wash

*2020.5.14*. This last weekend, [Caitlyn](http://caitlyndang.com) and I
backpacked up Cottonwood Wash in Utah's San Rafael Swell, a beautiful canyon all to ourselves. We even
spotted some petroglyphs.

# Course notes from CS183

*2020.4.20*. [These are my notes](files/lecture.pdf) from the course CS183:
Foundations of Machine Learning. They are imperfect and incomplete but I really
enjoyed making them. If you would like to make edits [email
me](mailto:matthewbfinlayson@gmail.com) and I can send you the source code.

<!--# The TNT game -->

<!--*2020.4.18*. While taking a class on theoretical computer science last semester-->
<!--someone showed me [the NAND game](http://nandgame.com/). The idea of the game-->
<!--is to start from a [NAND gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAND_gate) and-->
<!--build a series of [boolean-->
<!--circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_circuit) of increasing-->
<!--complexity until you build a computer in a surprisingly few number of rounds.-->
<!--While reading the book *[Gödel, Escher,-->
<!--Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gödel,_Escher,_Bach)* by Douglas-->
<!--Hofstadter, I began imagining a similar 'game' where the user begins with a-->
<!--small set of axioms and rules from  which they build theorems of increasing-->
<!--complexity. The axioms and rules could come from Hofstadter's [TNT-->
<!--system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographical_Number_Theory).  The game-->
<!--would begin by establishing basic properties of addition, multiplication, and-->
<!--so on, eventually proving profound mathematical concepts like Fermat's last-->
<!--theorem (about which I would recommend reading [this book by Simon-->
<!--Singh](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38412.Fermat_s_Enigma).) -->

<!--I'm not sure exactly how something like [Gödel's incompleteness-->
<!--theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems)-->
<!--could be incorporated into the game. It's something I will have to keep-->
<!--thinking about. :space_invader: -->

<!--# Notice anything new?-->

<!--*2020.4.17*. I overhauled the look of this site by ditching-->
<!--[Marx](https://github.com/mblode/marx) and making my own custom CSS file. I-->
<!--wanted an academic look for the site so I found [Latin-->
<!--Modern](https://github.com/slashfoo/lmweb) for web (LM is the $\LaTeX$ default-->
<!--font.) Also, inspired by [Butterick's Practical-->
<!--Typography](https://practicaltypography.com/) which is an amazing online book,-->
<!--I decided to go with more subtle links. They are now all [small caps](). The-->
<!--downside of this is that links do not pop out so much. Upside is that the focus-->
<!--is now more on the text!-->

<!--Oh, and I added a [favicon](https://favicon.io/). :nail_care: -->

*2020.4.16*. My [girlfriend](https://caitlyndang.com) made me this love-letter
website for Valentines day. I love it! (I hope I'm not embarrassing myself too
much here.) :heart:
