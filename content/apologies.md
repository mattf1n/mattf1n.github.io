title: Avoid Unnecessary Apologies
author: '[Matthew Finlayson](index.html)'

Here is something I wish someone told me earlier in my career:
only apologize when an apology is truly necessary.
An apology when there was no wrongdoing 
can look like an insecure bid for affirmation and encouragement,
which is awkward for the receiver.
It's a bit like fishing for compliments.

I see this a lot in emails, especially in cold emails.
If you are cold-emailing someone, don't apologize.
You don't owe them an apology.
Instead, thank them for their time.
If they don't read it, they won't be thanked for their time.

Whenever I feel the urge to apologize, I ask myself two questions.

1. Do I really owe an apology?
1. Can I replace this apology with gratitude? I.e., "thank you..."

Of course, if your actions have a negative effect on someone,
please apologize.
