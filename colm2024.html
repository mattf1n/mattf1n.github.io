<p>I’ve been looking for papers that engage with the whether model
collapse is a problem for LLMs. This paper looks like it does.</p>

<p>I hadn’t thought about PEFT for compressed models before so this idea
caught my attention and I talked to these authors a bit. My
understanding is that LoRA trained with a full model doesn’t work so
well when the the model gets compressed. So they train another LoRA with
a non-linearity to correct the degradation. Their explanation is that
the correct update for a compressed model is no longer expressible in
low-rank. I’m not convinced that this is the best way, it seems
fundamentally inelegant to just add on more parameters, and it seems
like there should be an equivalent PEFT method that adds no
parameters.</p>

<p>Cool paper from FLaNN people at COLM. I would be interested in seeing
how well this would work if it were compiled to a transformer. Are there
any C-RASP to transformer compilers?</p>

<p>I’ve always wondered about this. I’m glad someone studied it!
Interesting distinction between “pre-caching” and “breakcrumbs”.
Breadcrumbs never seemed plausible to me.</p>

alt="Unforgettable Generalization" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Unforgettable Generalization</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I talked to the authors about the mechanism for this phenomenon and
it fits with an intuition I have about overparameterization in LLMs,
that mechanisms/pathways within the model persist even after they are no
longer used because the extra computation is “free”.</p>

<p>Relates to our current work on masking gradients from tokens we don’t
want to learn to generate but are important for context. Relates because
they don’t mask gradients from these tokens BUT they told me some
followup work tried it (maybe unpublished) and it didn’t make a
difference. Bodes poorly for us perhaps?</p>

<p>This just seems like an RNN. Do we already use RNNs for speculative
decoding models?</p>

<p>Another pretrained transformer to pretrained RNN recipe. Very
relevant to our current project (except we want to initialize with a
better softmax approximation).</p>

<p>Seems like a very general deep learning finding. I haven’t worked on
problems in this area before, but I am interested in model merging for a
potential future project, which seems to be a critical component
here.</p>

<p>I want to give this one a closer read, but it seems like an
interesting approach that could inform future improvements to
long-context LLMs.</p>
